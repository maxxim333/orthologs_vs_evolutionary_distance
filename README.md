# orthologs_vs_evolutionary_distance
The goal of this work is to find what relationship does the evolutionary distance of a specie from Homo Sapiens have on the number of orthologs that appear for that specie for any of the 6000 clinically relevant human genes. In this exercise, I work with .nwk files to retreive evolutionary distances between a set of proteins of different species using PhyloTree module of Python, launch a shell script to get the orthologues of a subset oh about 6000 human genes, create a file where for each specie, a number of times the protein belonging to that specie appears in the ortholog list in Homo Sapiens and finally launch and R script that creates a plot and linear regression showing the negative correlation between evolutionary distance and number of orthologs.
